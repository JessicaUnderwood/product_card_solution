## My process
- First, I decided if I wanted to use flexbox or grid. I am more comfortable with flexbox at the moment so I decided to use that.
- Next, I decided which elements needed to be grouped together so that my flexbox positioned everything correctly.
- Once everything was positioned, I styled the elements.
- I knew I needed the elements to stack for mobile view so using flexbox was helpful as I only needed to change the direction to column and add height and width so the mobile photo would show on smaller screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
- Got more practice learning how to group elements in divs to get them to work properly using flexbox.
- More experience using media queries
- Its always fun watching a website become more and more responsive the more you code along.
- How to make the image have rounded corners using different border-radius properties.

### Continued development

I'm still not 100% comfortable with flexbox but I got a better idea of how to center and create cards just from this challenge. I want to continue learning all I can about flexbox and grids and maybe try this same challenge using grid and bootstrap next time.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://grid.malven.co/) - This helped me play around with trying my solution using grid. It's a really awesome resource to get an idea of how the layouts work.
- [Resource 2](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - Helped me when I didn't understand why my image wasn't showing when switching to mobile view. Turns out others had the same issues but it was as simple as adjusting width and height.
- [Resource 2](https://www.zerotomastery.io) - For overall development help and where I learned more about CSS grid and flexbox.
